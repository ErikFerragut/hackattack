Main things we learned:
\begin{enumerate}
\item k-2 > k2 -- since your opponent knows so little about your situation, you are better off just thinking about your own moves; this somewhat justifies attack trees, graphs, and petri nets.
\item k-3 is super slow! so we couldn't test the benefits of scanning deeper moves
\end{enumerate}



How can we improve this?
\begin{enumerate}
\item Make it more realistic by modeling a specific enterprise network
\item Introduce system owner moves, like system refresh, nessus scans, etc.
\item Speed up the deeper analysis by:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Exploit symmetries that result from lack of information (e.g., it doesn't matter what you hack if you don't know anything about any machine)
  \item Search the min-max tree more intelligently
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
