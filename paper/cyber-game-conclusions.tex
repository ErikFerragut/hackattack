We have shown that an application of game theoretic methods can be used
to analyze a more realistic cyber game than has been heretofore been
studied. In the process, we created strategies that exploit searches
of trees comprised of possible moves. Using simple functions that
evaluate the value of any game situation together with a tree
searching capability, we showed that the resulting strategies can
produce intelligent, nuanced strategies. For example, the resulting
strategies took into account the player's relative advantage based on
the quality of their exploits.  Also, we found that in cases of
extreme uncertainty, it is often better to ignore one's opponent's
possible moves.

One area of interest worthy of further analysis is the investigation
into the value of certainty. 
By creating an alternative
evaluation function that adds some weight to the information content in
the knowledge of the game, the strategy could emphasize an intrinsic
value of learning the OS of computers and the players on each
machine. Such an evaluation function might allow a 1-ply search to
mimic the strategies that were found to be so effective in the 2-ply
No-Response strategy.
